# Introduction
While the PlayStation port of Diablo suffered from obvious downsides such as downscaling graphics by 40% and abysmal loading times, it did have many new features and changes.

All known improvements are showcased here on a golden plaque dedicated to the port.

*Note that the images have reduced quality to keep file sizes down.*

## Graphics
The PSX port features 16-bit graphics that allowed for new colors and effects not possible on the PC--which was limited to 256 (8-bit) colors.

#### Braziers

- The graphic for braziers was redrawn to look nicer.
- A glowing effect was added on top of the flames.
- The flame animation was changed for the final game but used the same graphic as the PC in the beta.
- Additionally a "flicker" effect is applied to the lighting of braziers and torches in the beta.
  - It was likely removed due to concerns for epileptic people.

## Sound

#### Fading
- The volume of music fades in and out during load times. It also fades out when speeches play.

#### Reverb
- A reverb effect is added to all sound effects when outside of Tristram. This gives the dungeon a more "open" and "dark" feel.

## Unused
There are several features that were removed from the game. Some are still in the code but disabled, others were active in the beta builds.

#### Weird

- There is an unused function called `SetWeirdFX` that makes the screen flash rainbow colors.
- In the final game the flashing effect is only used by Apocalypse to flash white.
