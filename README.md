Documenting improvements made in the PSX port of Diablo

## Introduction
While the PlayStation port of Diablo suffered from obvious downsides, such as downscaling graphics by 40% and abysmal loading times, it did feature many improvements.

All known improvements are showcased here on a golden plaque dedicated to the PSX port.

## Graphics
The PSX port features 16-bit graphics that allowed for new colors and effects not possible on the PC--which was limited to 256 (8-bit colors).

### Braziers

- The graphic for braziers was redrawn to look nicer.
- An extra lighting effect is drawn on top of the flames.
- The flame animation was changed for the final game but used the same graphic as the PC in the beta.
- Additionally a "flicker" effect is applied to the lighting of braziers and torches in the beta.
  - It was likely removed due to concerns for epileptic people.
